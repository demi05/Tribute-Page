          <h3>Major events of Queen Elizabeth II's life:</h3>
          <div class="major-events">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span id="birth"><b>Birth</b>- </span>Born Elizabeth Alexandra
                Mary, Princess of York on 21 April 1926 to her parents, Duke and
                Duchess of York who would later become King George VI and Queen
                Elizabeth the Queen Mother. She was Queen of the United Kingdom
                and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her
                death in 2022.

                <span"><b>Princess Margaret</b>- </span>She was joined
                by a sister, Princess Margaret. She became Countess of Snowdon
                after marrying her husband, Antony Armstrong-Jones whom the
                Queen made Earl of Snowdon. They divorced in 1978. Margaret was
                a controversial member of the British royal family. Her divorce
                received much negative publicity, and her private life was for
                many years the subject of intense speculation by media and
                royal-watchers. Her health gradually deteriorated in the final
                two decades of her life. She was a heavy smoker for most of her
                adult life, and had a lung operation in 1985, a bout of
                pneumonia in 1993, and at least three strokes between 1998 and
                2001. She died in London on 9 February 2002, after suffering a
                fourth and final stroke at the age of 71.

                created Duke of Edinburgh on the day of their wedding. Philip
                had first met the then Princess Elizabeth in 1934. In July 1939,

                <span><b>annus horribilis</b>- </span>The expression

                speech at Guildhall on 24 November 1992, marking her Ruby
                Jubilee on the throne, she said:
                <q
                  >1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted
                  pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic
                  correspondents, it has turned out to be an
                  <i>annus horribilis</i>.
                </q>
                Many unpleasant events happened to the royal family that year.

                <span><b>Death of Prince Phillip</b>- </span>Philip is

              </li>
              <li>
                <span><b>Reign</b>- </span>Elizabeth reigned as a
                constitutional monarch through major political changes such as
                the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United
                Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's
                accession to the European Communities and withdrawal from the
                European Union. The number of her realms varied over time as
                territories gained independence and some realms became
                republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include state
                visits to China in 1986, Russia in 1994, and the Republic of
                Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes. In February 2022,
                the Queen celebrated her 70th year as the monarch of Britian.
                Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British
                monarch, the longest recorded of any female head of state in
                history, and the second-longest verified reign of any monarch in
                history. She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her
                lifetime and 15 at the time of her death.

                III.. She was buried on the 19th of September 2022 at King
                George VI Memorial Chapel, St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
                Her state funeral was the first to be held in the United Kingdom since that of Winston Churchill in 1965.

Perhaps, part of that wisdom is to recognize some of life's baffling paradoxes such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil</blockquote> -<i>Queen Elizabeth II</i></p>
